I apologize for any confusion in my previous responses. Let's break down the formula new_matrix[j][M-i-1] = original_matrix[i][j] and explain why it's [M-i-1] for the y-coordinate after a 90-degree clockwise rotation.

In a 2D matrix, the indices i and j represent the row and column indices, respectively.

i: Original row index (corresponding to the y-coordinate).
j: Original column index (corresponding to the x-coordinate).
Now, let's consider the rotated matrix. After a 90-degree clockwise rotation:

The rows of the original matrix become the columns of the rotated matrix.
The columns of the original matrix become the rows of the rotated matrix.
So, in the formula new_matrix[j][M-i-1] = original_matrix[i][j]:

j: Represents the new column index (corresponding to the new x-coordinate).
M-i-1: Represents the new row index (corresponding to the new y-coordinate).
The M-i-1 expression is used to reflect the change in the row indices during the rotation. Here's why:

M: Represents the total number of rows in the original matrix.
i: Represents the original row index (y-coordinate).
In a 90-degree clockwise rotation, the new row index (new y-coordinate) is obtained by subtracting the original row index from the total number of rows and subtracting 1. This is because indices are zero-based, and the last row in the original matrix becomes the first row in the rotated matrix.

So, in summary, M-i-1 is used to calculate the new row index (new y-coordinate) after the 90-degree clockwise rotation. I hope this clarifies the reasoning behind that expression.
